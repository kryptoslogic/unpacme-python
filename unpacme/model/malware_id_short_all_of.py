     # Introduction Welcome to the UNPACME API! All the malware unpacking and file analysis features that you are familiar with on the [unpac.me](https://www.unpac.me/) website are available through our API. You can easily integrate our unpacker into your malware analysis pipeline and begin unpacking at scale!   # Authentication The public UNPACME API is publicly available and can be accessed without authentication.  In order to use the private UNPACME API you must sign up for an account with UNPACME. Once you have a valid user account you can view your personal API key in your user profile.   <SecurityDefinitions />  # Response Structure When interacting with the UNPACME API, if the request was correctly handled, a <b>200</b> HTTP status code will be returned. The body of the response will usually be a JSON object (except for file downloads).  ## Response Status Codes  Status Code  | Description | Notes ------------- | ------------- | - 200  | OK | The request was successful 400  | Bad Request | The request was somehow incorrect. This can be caused by missing arguments or arguments with wrong values. 401 | Unauthorized | The supplied credentials, if any, are not sufficient to access the resource 403 | Forbidden | The account does not have enough privileges to make the request. 404 | Not Found | The requested resource is not found 429  | Too Many Requests | The request frequency has exceeded one of the account quotas (minute, daily or monthly). Monthly quotas are reset on the 1st of the month at 00:00 UTC. 500 | Server Error | The server could not return the representation due to an internal server error   ## Error Response  If an error has occurred while handling the request an error status code will be returend along with a JSON error message with the following properties.   Property  | Description ------------- | ------------- Error  | The error type Description  | A more informative message  # Example Clients  The following clients can be used to interact with the UNPACME API directly and are provided as examples.

                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be

                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to

                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when

                                If omitted no type conversion is done.

                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its

                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
